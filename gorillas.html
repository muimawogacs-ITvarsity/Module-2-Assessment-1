                <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
                <P>The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos.</P>
                <P>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 metres, weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback.</P>
                <P>The Eastern gorilla is distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 35–40 years in the wild.</P>
                <P>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forest in Sub-Saharan Africa. </P>
