                <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
                <P>Giraffe is a family of G/H (formerly C-band) frequency agile, low to medium altitude pulse doppler air search radars and combat control centers which can be used in mobile or static short to medium range air defense applications. </P>
                <P>Giraffe is designed to detect low-altitude, low cross-section aircraft targets in conditions of severe clutter and electronic countermeasures. When equipped as an air-defense command center Giraffe provides an air picture to each firing battery using man portable radio communication.</P>
                <P>Giraffe uses Agile Multi-Beam (AMB), which includes an integrated Command, control and communication (C3) system. This enables Giraffe to act as the command and control center in an air defense system, it can also be integrated into a sensor net for greater coverage. It is normally housed in a single 6m long shelter mounted on an all-terrain vehicle for high mobility. Additionally the shelter can be augmented with Nuclear, Biological and Chemical protection and light layers of armor to protect against small arms and fragmentation threats.</P>
