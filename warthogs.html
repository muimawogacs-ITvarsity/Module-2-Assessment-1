                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <P>They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
                <P>The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus</P>
                <P>Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired.</P>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
                <P>at E02</P>
