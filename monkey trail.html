                <h3>MONKEY TRAIL</h3>
                <p>This challenging red (difficult) cross country pine city zoo trail was first launched in 2010. The trail surface is very variable, in places expect loose stone, roots and mud. Designed with very experienced mountain bikers in mind, this trail is far more physically and technically challenging and demanding than Follow the Dog. It features bigger, stepper climbs and more technical descents.</p>
                      <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND IT?</p>
                      <p>MONKEY TRAIL is to the west of the main entrance.</p>
