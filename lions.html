                <h3>LIONS</h3>
                <P>It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.</P>
                <P> It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs.</P>
                <P>Typically, the lion inhabits grasslands and savannas, but is absent in dense forests. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight.</P>
                <P> Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</P>
