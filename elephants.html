                <h3>ELEPHANTS</h3>
                <P>Elephants are the largest existing land animals.</P>
                <P> African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin.</P>
                <P>Elephants are scattered throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Southeast Asia and are found in different habitats, including savannahs, forests, deserts, and marshes.</P>
                <P>They are considered to be keystone species, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a fissionâ€“fusion society, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise.</P>
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></p>
